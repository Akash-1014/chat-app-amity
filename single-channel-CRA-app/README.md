[Try me on codesandbox!](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/AmityCo/Amity-Social-Cloud-SDK-Web-Sample-App/tree/main/single-channel-CRA-app)

## Stack used

- ReactJS through [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- ReactJS hooks

## Scope of demo

From a simple `npx create-react-app XXX` boilerplate, we've added the minimal amount of code to create a single channel chat app.

You will be able to see the typical use of live objects and live collections working with react hooks, and the typical implementation for a chat app.
